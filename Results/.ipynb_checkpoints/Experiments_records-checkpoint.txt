We have conducted several experiments with the synthetic data. This document has the records of the parameters used for those experiments.
The basic parameters that were fixed for all the experiments are listed below.

N(instances) = 1000
modes = ['intercept', 'slope', 'both']
effective_groups = list(range(3,9))
visible_groups = list(range(10,260,20))
fixed_slope = N(0, 1)
fixed_intercept = 0
fixed_error = N(0, 1)
seed = 100

We have run simulations for data with only a single continuous feature along with categorical features and data with multiple(5) continuous features along with categorical features.

The following results were calculated by considering visible(gV) groups as a grouping feature and effective(gE) groups were avoided.

1) r1 -> single and multiple

    single: number_of_contineous_features = 1
    multiple: number_of_contineous_features = 5

    random_effects_distribution = 'linspace'; re_intercept = (-10,10) ; re_slope = (-10,10)
    error_type = 'on_target' ; re_error = (0,3)
    shuffle_groups = True


2) r2 -> single and multiple

    single: number_of_contineous_features = 1
    multiple: number_of_contineous_features = 5

    random_effects_distribution = 'normal'; re_intercept = (0,5) ; re_slope = (0,5)
    error_type = 'on_target' ; re_error = (0,3)
    shuffle_groups = True

3) r3 -> single and multiple

    single: number_of_contineous_features = 1
    multiple: number_of_contineous_features = 5

    random_effects_distribution = 'linspace'; re_intercept = (-10,10) ; re_slope = (-10,10)
    error_type = 'on_group' ; re_error = (0,3)
    shuffle_groups = True

4) r4 -> single and multiple

    single: number_of_contineous_features = 1
    multiple: number_of_contineous_features = 5

    random_effects_distribution = 'normal'; re_intercept = (0,5) ; re_slope = (0,5)
    error_type = 'on_group' ; re_error = (0,3)
    shuffle_groups = True

5) r5 -> single and multiple

    single: number_of_contineous_features = 1
    multiple: number_of_contineous_features = 5

    random_effects_distribution = 'linspace'; re_intercept = (-10,10) ; re_slope = (-10,10)
    error_type = 'on_target' ; re_error = (0,3)
    shuffle_groups = False


6) r6 -> single and multiple

    single: number_of_contineous_features = 1
    multiple: number_of_contineous_features = 5

    random_effects_distribution = 'normal'; re_intercept = (0,5) ; re_slope = (0,5)
    error_type = 'on_target' ; re_error = (0,3)
    shuffle_groups = False
